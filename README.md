- `summary` (Counts for mutation types `summary/basic_mutation.txt`, subsitution subtypes `summary/basic_subs_mutations.txt`, and within coding and noncoding regions `summary/CDS_v_noncoding/CDS_v_noncoding_linecounts.txt`). Analysis in `plot_muts.ipynb`
- `CDS_v_nCDS/plot.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook file for coding vs noncoding mutation analysis plots from output of `CDS_v_nCDS/CDS_v_noncoding_bedtools.sh`)
- `num/` (contains distribution data for TFBS, TSS, TES, splice sites, CpG islands, ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, WGBS. Jupyter note book for all distribution plots: `num/distribution.ipynb`)
- `repli/tables` (Data for analysis of Repli-seq and Jupyter notebook for its analysis in `repliseq.ipynb`).
- `alu/tables` (Data for analysis of mutations in repetitive elements. Analysis in `alu/clustermaps/clustermaps.ipynb`).
